# Quiz 4 Corrections
## Question 10
Match the access modifier with its visibility. <br>
Access Modifiers:
* Public
* Private
* Default
* Protected

Visibility options: <br>
+ visible within the class in which it is defined, as well as by classes within the same package
+ visible only within the class in which it's defined
+ visible by all classes in all packages
+ visible within the class in which it's defined, by classes within the same package, and by subclasses of the class in which it's defined
+ dynamic
+ static
+ package
<br><br>

The correct answer is: 
* public: visible by all classes in all packages
* private: visible only within the class in which it's defined
* default: visible within the class in which it is defined, as well as by classes within the same package
* protected: visible within the class in which it's defined, by classes within the same package, and by subclasses of the class in which it's defined

These are the correct answers because they stem directly from the definitions of those keywords, and how they were created. <br>
Any other explanation does not properly map the correct definition to the correct term.
